# IBM Machine Learning Capstone

In this Machine Learning Capstone course, I used various Python-based machine learning libraries such as Pandas, scikit-learn, Tensorflow/Keras, to: 

- build a course recommender system,
- analyze course related datasets, calculate cosine similarity, and create a similarity matrix,
- create recommendation systems by applying your knowledge of KNN, PCA, and non-negative matrix collaborative filtering,
- build similarity-based recommender systems,
- predict course ratings by training a neural network and constructing regression and classification models,
- build a Streamlit app that displays your work, and
- share your work then evaluate your peers.
